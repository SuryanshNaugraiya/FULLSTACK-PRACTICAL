    <h2>About Course</h2>
    <p>
        The front end is built out of three languages: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. HTML allows us to put content on our page: text, headers, images, buttons, links, and etc. CSS is used to style our page. It allows the contents to have different text colors, background colors, as well as dealing with the positioning of the content on the page. JavaScript makes our page dynamic. It allows for the content to change on a mouse hover or click and also lets us submit data and have data rendered on our page (such as submitting a new blog post or having your feed populated when you open Facebook).
